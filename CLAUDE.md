# jtvec — standing instructions (auto-loaded every session)

v2 measurement stack for one claim, currently HYPOTHESIS tier and never to
be stated as a finding: task execution and task verbalization are causally
separable in language models (HYPOTHESIS). v1 lives on in vendored form
only (VENDORING.md); its FV numbers are contaminated by draw instability.

## Read first, in this order

1. `CONSTRAINTS.md` — the constitution. LAW entries are inviolable; the
   VERIFIED/PROVISIONAL/HYPOTHESIS tags bound what may be stated as fact.
   If any instruction conflicts with a LAW, stop and flag.
2. `LABNOTES.md` (end to end) — decisions D-NNN, milestone sign-offs,
   current state. Append-only; sign-offs and `verify:` lines are
   Ecaterina's alone.
3. `VENDORING.md` — what came from v1 and the byte-identical policy:
   vendored v1 code is not rewritten, and vendored != in use.

## Build order and sign-off protocol

M0 skeleton -> M1 lens gate -> M2 FV stability gate -> M3 interventions ->
M4 confirmatory experiments (E1 decodability -> E2 dissociation -> E3 swap
-> E4 confabulation; emergence sweep LAST, only with per-checkpoint AIE and
the M2 gate passing at >= 2 checkpoints). A milestone starts only after
Ecaterina's `sign-off: M<k>` line exists in LABNOTES for the previous one.
Nothing FV-dependent runs before the M2 gate produces a converged trial
count (or a documented non-convergence).

## Hard rules beyond the LAWs (from the project brief)

- Estimate wall-clock + peak memory before any run > 10 min; anything
  projected > 12 h does not run on a laptop — flag it for the A100 and let
  Ecaterina rule.
- Report numbers only with scope: "on <model>, <config>, N=<n>, we
  observed X (sham: Y)" — never "the model can X". Use
  `jtvec.core.reporting`; the validators lint the rest.
- If a result surprises you, the next action is a raw-output replay, not
  an interpretation.
- Any deviation from a prereg or the plan requires a flagged decision that
  Ecaterina answers. Propose, never silently adopt.

## Engineering conventions

- `uv` only; deps stay pinned (torch 2.13.0, transformers 5.13.1,
  python 3.11). Submodules: `third_party/jacobian-lens` @ 581d398,
  `third_party/function_vectors` @ fb9eac7 — never advance them.
- Every scientific run goes through `jtvec.core.runctx.start_run`
  (committed prereg + clean tree enforced; configs copied; raw outputs
  retained). Commit the experiment before running it.
- `uv run pytest -q` and `uv run python -m jtvec.validators` must pass
  before every push; CI runs both.
- Long local runs: launch detached (`nohup ... &`) with a Monitor on the
  log — harness-tracked background Bash tasks get killed after ~1 h
  (learned in M1; incident in LABNOTES).
- MPS quirks the vendored code already handles: fp32 only (fp16 broken on
  MPS for this stack), `torch.linalg.pinv` on CPU, the transformers-5
  FV-hook patch in `jvec/fv.py` (needs its landing test before M2 use).

## Current state (update this line at each milestone boundary)

M0, M1 complete and signed off (M1 gate PASS R1-R6, bit-for-bit v1
reproduction + 3-draw stability; `results/m1/20260718-010559-lens-gate`).
M2 build complete; platform is now a win32 laptop with an RTX 2000 Ada
(D-008: vendored `resource` guard, UTF-8 reads, cu130 torch). Compute
ruled by D-009 (~5.5 h ladder on this GPU). After runs 1-2 fired the
control gate (D-010 bound amendment; then a round(x,4) conformance fix),
run 3 completed 2026-07-18: M2 gate PASS — converged_at=25 on all three
tasks, certificates in `results/m2/20260718-114950-fv-stability-gate`.
Awaiting Ecaterina's `sign-off: M2`; nothing FV-dependent starts before
it. Open note: v1's cross-code-path instability vs same-pipeline draw
stability here (LABNOTES run-1 entry) is unresolved.
